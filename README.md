#Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!
#We want to create a project by building my first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration.

The AirBnB console will perform the following tasks:

#Create a new object.
#Retrive an object from a file.
#Do operations on objects.
#To destroy an object.
